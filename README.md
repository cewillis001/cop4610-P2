# cop4610-P2
P2 Shell Level Process Management

This was a small project for COP 4610 Operating Systems to demonstrate process managment using a shell. You can see more information about the parameters of the project in [P2 Definition.pdf](./P2 Description.pdf). Most of the code belongs to Dr. Baker and is used with permission; my contributions are the file [testall](./testall) and parts of [testone](./testone).
